# Solutions for Sign-in and Feed Subscription Issues

## âœ… Issues Fixed:

### 1. Sign-in Failed Error - RESOLVED
**Root Cause**: Deep link scheme mismatch between OAuth configuration and app.json
- **Problem**: OAuth was using `vicinapp` scheme but deep links were configured for `vicin`
- **Solution**: Updated `app.json` to use consistent `vicinapp` scheme and correct `oauth-callback` path

### 2. Feed Subscription Error - RESOLVED
**Root Cause**: Real-time subscription failures without proper retry logic
- **Problem**: Network issues or temporary Supabase connectivity problems caused permanent subscription failures
- **Solution**: Added robust retry logic with exponential backoff (up to 3 retries)

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made:

### File: `app.json`
- Fixed deep link scheme from `vicin` to `vicinapp`
- Updated deep link path from `auth-callback` to `oauth-callback`

### File: `lib/oauth.ts`
- Added debug logging for OAuth redirect URIs and auth URLs
- This will help identify any remaining OAuth issues

### File: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- Enhanced real-time subscription with retry logic
- Added exponential backoff for failed connections
- Improved error logging and status tracking

## ðŸ§ª Testing Steps:

1. **Test Sign-in with Google:**
   - Try signing in with Google
   - Check console logs for OAuth debug information
   - Verify successful redirect after authentication

2. **Test Feed Subscription:**
   - Open the app and check console for "Feed subscription active" message
   - If you see "Feed subscription error", the retry logic should automatically attempt reconnection
   - Create a new post to test real-time updates

3. **Verify Deep Links:**
   - The OAuth callback should now properly redirect to your app
   - Check that the scheme `vicinapp://oauth-callback` works correctly

## ðŸš¨ Additional Recommendations:

### Supabase Configuration Check:
1. **Verify OAuth Providers in Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to Authentication > Providers
   - Ensure Google OAuth is enabled
   - Check that redirect URLs include your app's scheme

2. **Check Row Level Security (RLS):**
   - Verify that your `posts` table has appropriate RLS policies
   - Ensure real-time subscriptions are allowed for your user roles

3. **Network Connectivity:**
   - Test on different networks (WiFi vs cellular)
   - Check if corporate firewalls might block Supabase connections

### If Issues Persist:

1. **Check Supabase Project Status:**
   - Visit your Supabase dashboard to ensure the project is active
   - Check for any service outages

2. **Verify Environment Variables:**
   - Ensure `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correct
   - Check that the Supabase project is not paused

3. **OAuth Provider Setup:**
   - In Google Cloud Console, verify OAuth client is configured correctly
   - Ensure redirect URIs match what your app is sending

## ðŸ“± Next Steps:

1. Restart your development server: `npx expo start --clear`
2. Test sign-in functionality with the debug logs enabled
3. Monitor console output for any remaining issues
4. If problems persist, check the Supabase dashboard for additional error details
